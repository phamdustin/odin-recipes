        <h2> Description</h2>

        <h4>This Lasagna Recipe is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. BONUS: it’s make-ahead and freezer-friendly!</h5>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for
                 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice 
                 offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
            </li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula 
                to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, 
                or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides 
                of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire 
                sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the 
                sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°.

            </li>
            <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a 
                rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. 
                (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon 
                throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold
                 water until noodles are completely cool.
            </li>
            <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling 
                the lasagna.
            </li>

        </ol>
